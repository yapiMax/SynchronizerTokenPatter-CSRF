# SynchronizerTokenPattern-CSRF

Synchronizer Token Pattern is a method that can be used to avoid CSRF. In this project I have explained how to implement a simple application and secure it from CSRF.

To build the project with maven use below command.
```
mvn clean install
```
or
```
mvn package
```
Then depoly the .war file which is in "target" folder, in tomcat.

Then run the applcation in the browser.
